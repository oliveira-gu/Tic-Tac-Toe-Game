# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

This is one of the exercises I had to do in the discipline "Algorithms and Programming: Linear Structures" at Unisinos. The goal here was to develop the tic-tac-toe game in the Java programming language.
It was the first exercise of the discipline, and I remeber how hard it was to understand some of the subjects used here, one of them was matrix. Until then I had only used vectors, so they didn't have two dimensions.
The following structure int[][] matrix and the loop for used to scan all the positions inside it was a challenge.
