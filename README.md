# Tic-Tac-Toe Game ðŸŽ®

This project is part of an exercise from the "Algorithms and Programming: Linear Structures" course at Unisinos. The objective was to develop the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Java programming language.

## About the Project
In this implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe, two players take turns marking positions in a 3x3 grid, with the goal of aligning three symbols ('X' or 'O') in a rowâ€”either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This was one of the first exercises of the course, and I remember how challenging it was to understand some of the concepts, especially working with matrices. Before this, I had only used one-dimensional arrays, so dealing with two-dimensional structures like `int[][] matrix` and using loops to iterate through all the positions inside it was a new and rewarding challenge.

## Features
- Two-player mode
- Validates win conditions and draws
- Basic command-line interface for interaction

## Technologies Used
- Java
